# MM Health Tracker - Development Roadmap

## üéØ Project Overview

Building a comprehensive health tracking application using the **MM Design System** with focus on calorie tracking, exercise logging, weight monitoring, and injection management.

**Core Philosophy**: Build incrementally with working features at each phase. Deploy early, test constantly, iterate based on actual usage. **Build one page at a time to completion.**

---

## üìã Pre-Development Setup

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.0 + MM Design System
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage (Phase 0-3), then Supabase (Phase 4+)
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Deployment**: Vercel (from Day 1)
- **Dependencies**: @heroicons/react, recharts, uuid

### Design System Integration
- Use existing MM Design System from `design-system-cpn/`
- **Primary Color**: `--color-mm-blue: #00A1FE`
- **Component Classes**: `.btn-mm`, `.input-mm`, `.card-mm`, etc.
- Copy font files to `/public/fonts/`
- Import `styles/globals.css` in main layout
- Use `bg-mm-dark text-mm-white` on root layout

## üöÄ Phase 0: Foundation & Data Input (Week 1)

**Goal**: Get core tracking operational immediately

### Day 1: Project Setup
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest mm-health-tracker --typescript --tailwind --app
cd mm-health-tracker
npm install @heroicons/react recharts uuid @types/uuid
```

### Days 1-2: Core Infrastructure

**1. Data Models** (`lib/types.ts`)
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  bmr: number;           // Basal Metabolic Rate
  height: number;        // cm
  weight: number;        // kg
  gender: 'male' | 'female' | 'other';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface DailyEntry {
  id: string;
  date: string;          // YYYY-MM-DD format (unique per day)
  calories: CalorieEntry[];
  exercises: ExerciseEntry[];
  weight?: number;       // Daily weight entry
  deepWorkCompleted: boolean;
  injections: InjectionEntry[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface CalorieEntry {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  calories: number;
  carbs: number;
  protein: number;
  fat: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

interface ExerciseEntry {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  duration: number;      // minutes
  caloriesBurned: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

interface InjectionEntry {
  id: string;
  compound: 'Testosterone' | 'Maralyn' | 'Rita Trutard' | string;
  dosage: number;
  unit: string;
  notes?: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

**2. Storage Layer** (`lib/storage.ts`)
```typescript
export const profileStorage = {
  get: (): UserProfile | null => { /* localStorage logic */ },
  save: (profile: UserProfile): void => { /* localStorage logic */ },
  update: (updates: Partial<UserProfile>): UserProfile => { /* localStorage logic */ }
};

export const dailyEntryStorage = {
  getByDate: (date: string): DailyEntry | null => { /* localStorage logic */ },
  createOrUpdate: (date: string, updates: Partial<DailyEntry>): DailyEntry => { /* localStorage logic */ },
  getAll: (): DailyEntry[] => { /* localStorage logic */ }
};
```

### Days 3-4: Essential Pages

**Page 1: Profile Setup** (`/profile`)
- BMR manual input field (critical for calculations)
- Height, weight, gender inputs
- Save to localStorage
- Clean, simple form using `.input-mm` classes

**Page 2: Daily Tracker** (`/daily`)
- **Left Side**: Input forms
  - Quick calorie entry (name, calories, carbs, protein, fat)
  - Exercise entry (type, duration, calories burned)
  - Weight entry (updates daily value)
  - Deep work completion checkbox
- **Right Side**: Today's real-time stats
  - **Calorie Balance**: `BMR - food calories + exercise calories`
  - Running calorie total
  - Macros breakdown (carbs/protein/fat)
  - Items logged today list

**Critical Calculation Logic**:
```typescript
// Real-time calorie balance
const calorieBalance = bmr - totalFoodCalories + totalExerciseCalories;

// Example: 2000 BMR - 1500 food + 600 exercise = 1100 remaining
```

### Days 5-7: Injection Tracker & Deployment

**Page 3: Injection Tracker** (`/injections/add`)
- Compound dropdown: Testosterone, Maralyn, Rita Trutard, Custom
- Dosage input with unit selection
- Date selector (defaults to today)
- Optional notes field
- Quick save with immediate feedback

**Deployment Setup**:
- Deploy to Vercel on Day 5
- Test all pages work in production
- Verify localStorage persistence
- Test on mobile devices

## ‚ö° Critical Success Factors

### Development Principles
1. **Deploy on Day 1** - Use Vercel, test immediately in production
2. **Data Input First** - If you can't input data easily, nothing else matters
3. **Real-time Calculations** - Show calorie balance as user types
4. **Desktop-First Design** - Optimize for desktop, responsive as secondary
5. **One Page at a Time** - Complete each page fully before moving on
6. **Follow Existing Design** - Use MM Design System exactly as provided

### Build Order Priority
```
1. Profile page (BMR setup) - Foundation for all calculations
2. Daily tracker page - Core functionality, most important page
3. Dashboard - Overview and motivation
4. Injection tracker - Specialized tracking
5. History view - Data review
6. Analytics pages - Insights
7. Planning pages - Forward-looking
8. Settings - Configuration and export
```

### What NOT to Build Initially
- Authentication system (use localStorage)
- Database integration (localStorage first)
- Complex sharing features
- API integrations
- Custom styling (use MM Design System)
- PWA features
- Month view heatmaps

---

## üìê Implementation Notes

### Calorie Math Reference
```typescript
// Core calculation that drives the entire app
const dailyCalorieRemaining = bmr - foodCalories + exerciseCalories;

// Examples:
// Start of day: 2000 BMR = 2000 remaining
// After 1500 cal meal: 2000 - 1500 = 500 remaining
// After 600 cal exercise: 2000 - 1500 + 600 = 1100 remaining
```

### Design System Usage
- **Primary Theme**: Dark theme with blue accent (`#00A1FE`)
- **Component Pattern**: Use existing `.btn-mm`, `.input-mm`, `.card-mm` classes
- **Layout Pattern**: Flex-based app shell with sidebar and main content
- **Mobile Pattern**: Desktop sidebar ‚Üí Mobile bottom navigation
- **Typography**: National2Condensed (headings), ESKlarheit (body)

### Quality Gates
Each phase must meet these criteria before moving to next:
- ‚úÖ All pages fully functional
- ‚úÖ Matches design system exactly
- ‚úÖ Tested locally and on Vercel
- ‚úÖ Works on mobile devices
- ‚úÖ localStorage data persists correctly
- ‚úÖ Real-time calculations work properly
