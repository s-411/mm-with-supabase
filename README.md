## Database Architecture

All tables use Row Level Security (RLS) with Clerk-based authentication. User data is isolated using the `clerk_user_id()` function, ensuring users can only access their own data.

### Recent Database Migrations

- **Security Hardening**: Fixed mutable search_path vulnerabilities in 6 database functions
- **Performance Optimization**: Added foreign key indexes for faster query performance
- **Index Cleanup**: Removed unused indexes to improve write performance
