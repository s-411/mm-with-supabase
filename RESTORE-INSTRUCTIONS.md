# 🔄 MM Health Tracker - Data Restoration Guide

## ✅ What's Been Done

The auth system has been completely removed from your MM Health Tracker app. The app now works exactly like the original version - pure localStorage, no authentication, no database connections.

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Removed `AuthProvider` from the app
- ✅ Removed auth redirects and login requirements
- ✅ Removed sign-out buttons and user profile UI
- ✅ App now redirects directly to `/daily` on load

## 📦 Your Backup Files

You have **2 backup files** with all your data:

1. **`mm-health-backup-2025-09-25.json`** - Raw localStorage format (39KB)
2. **`mm-health-data-2025-09-25.json`** - Structured format (parsed objects)

Both files are in the project root and contain:
- ✅ **Profile Data** (BMR: 1800, Height: 181cm, Weight: 80.5kg)
- ✅ **43+ Daily Entries** (from Aug 12 - Sep 25, 2025)
- ✅ **2 Weekly Entries** with objectives and reviews
- ✅ **3 Compounds** (Retatrutide, Testosterone, Ipamorellin)
- ✅ **2 Injection Targets** with dosage tracking
- ✅ **3 Food Templates**
- ✅ **Nirvana Progress** (handstand milestones, body part mapping)
- ✅ **Settings** (timezone: Asia/Singapore, macro targets)

## 🎯 Quick Start After Restore

Once your data is restored:

1. **Check Daily Tracker** - Navigate to `/daily` to see your most recent entries
2. **Review Analytics** - Go to `/analytics` to see your weight chart (80-90kg range)
3. **Check Injections** - Visit `/injections` to see your dosage tracking
4. **Verify Profile** - Go to `/settings` to confirm your BMR and measurements

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No data showing after restore"
**Solution:** Make sure you refreshed the app page after restoring. Press Cmd+R (Mac) or Ctrl+R (Windows).

### Issue: "Restore tool not working"
**Solution:** Make sure you have the app running on localhost:3001. The restoration tool needs to write to the same origin.

### Issue: "Some data is missing"
**Solution:** Try the other backup file. You have two formats - if one doesn't work, the other should.

### Issue: "App shows auth screen"
**Solution:** The changes have been made. Make sure you're on the `Move-Menu` branch and run `npm install` then `npm run dev` again.

## 💾 Future Backups

To avoid losing data again, you can:

1. **Export regularly** - Use the app's export feature (if available)
2. **Browser DevTools** - Open DevTools > Application > Local Storage and manually copy
3. **Use the check tool** - Run `check-localstorage.html` periodically to export JSON backups

## 📝 Technical Details

### Backup File Format Comparison

**Raw localStorage format** (`mm-health-backup-2025-09-25.json`):
```json
{
  "mm-health-profile": "{\"bmr\":1800,\"height\":181,...}",
  "mm-daily-entry-2025-09-25": "{\"id\":\"x77qaqa7n\",...}",
  ...
}
```

**Structured format** (`mm-health-data-2025-09-25.json`):
```json
{
  "profile": { "bmr": 1800, "height": 181, ... },
  "dailyEntries": {
    "2025-09-25": { "id": "x77qaqa7n", ... }
  },
  ...
}
```

Both formats are **fully compatible** with the restoration tool.
